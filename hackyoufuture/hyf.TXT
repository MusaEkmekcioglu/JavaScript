So far I've learned that we create as 
many boxes as we want for html and there are nested boxes.
We call each of these boxes an "element"
   and
We also shape these boxes with css. 
We change their position, 
adjust their color and even add animation.




what is html ?

html stands for hyper text markup language,
 it is a language of the world wide web.
 it is a standard text formatting language
 which is used to create and display pages on the web.
html makes the text more interractive


Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?


No. HTML elements are defined by a starting tag, 
may contain some content and a closing tag.
For example, <h1>Heading 1</h1> is a HTML element but just <h1> 
is a starting tag and </h1> is a closing tag.



This field I am showing is an html element
bildiğim kadarıyla= as far as i know 


what is css?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
 It’s a style sheet language that determines how the elements

CSS enables the separation of the content from the presentation.
 This separation provides a lot of flexibility and control over
 how the website has to look like.
 This is the main advantage of using CSS.



How to include CSS in the webpage?


 External Style Sheet: An external file linked to your HTML document: 
Using link tag, we can link the style sheet to the HTML page.

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyles.css" />
2 - Embed CSS with a style tag: A set of CSS styles included 
within your HTML page.

<style type="text/css">

/*Add style rules here*/

</style>
Add your CSS rules between the opening and closing style tags
 and write your CSS exactly the same way as you do in stand-alone
 stylesheet files.

3 - Add inline styles to HTML elements
(CSS rules applied directly within an HTML tag.): 
Style can be added directly to the HTML element using a style tag.

<h2 style="color:red;background:black">Inline Style</h2>
4 - Import a stylesheet file (An external file imported into 
another CSS file): Another way to add CSS is by using the @import rule.
 This is to add a new CSS file within CSS itself.



 What is the difference between inline, inline-block, and block?



Block Element: The block elements always start on a new line.
 They will also take space for an entire row or width.
 List of block elements are <div>, <p>.

Inline Elements: Inline elements don't start on a new line, 
they appear on the same line as the content and tags beside them.
 Some examples of inline elements are <a>, <span> , <strong>, and <img> tags. 

Inline Block Elements: Inline-block elements are similar
 to inline elements, except they can have padding and margins
 added on all four sides







Explain CSS position property?
Absolute

To place an element exactly where you want to place it. 
absolute position is actually set relative to the element's parent. 
if no parent is available then the relative place to the page itself 
(it will default all the way back up to the element).

Relative

"Relative to itself". Setting position: relative;
 on an element and no other positioning attributes, 
it will no effect on its positioning. 
It allows the use of z-index on the element and it limits 
the scope of absolutely positioned child elements. 
Any child element will be absolutely positioned within that block. 

Fixed

The element is positioned relative to the 
viewport or the browser window itself. 
viewport doesn't change if you scroll and hence the fixed 
element will stay right in the same position. 

Static

Static default for every single page element.
 The only reason you would ever set an element to position:
 static is to forcefully-remove some positioning that got
 applied to an element outside of your control.

Sticky

Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning.
 The element is treated as relative positioned until it crosses a 
specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed positioned.





 Different Box Sizing Property?
The box-sizing CSS property sets how the total width and height of an element are calculated.

Content-box: The default width and height values apply to the element's content only. The padding and border are added to the outside of the box.

Padding-box: Width and height values apply to the element's content and its padding. The border is added to the outside of the box. Currently, only Firefox supports the padding-box value.

Border-box: Width and height values apply to the content, padding, and border.





What does * { box-sizing: border-box; } do? What are its advantages?
It makes every element in the document
 include the padding and border in the element’s inner
 dimension for the height and width computation.  
In box-sizing: border-box, The height of an element 
is now calculated by the content's height +
 vertical padding + vertical border width.

The width of an element is now calculated by the content's 
width + horizontal padding + horizontal border width.



universal selector



universe selector is matches any element types
 like instead of selecting elements of a particular 
type so we use an asterisk where the all
 elements irrespective of what name and what category
 they have it all will be selected  

A universal selector is a selector
 that matches all elements rather
 than selecting an element of a particular type.



how can css be integrated into an html page?


1-using sytle tags in the head section
2- using inline-styling
3-linking html page with css




what is meant by rgb stream ?


rgb represents color in css. the three streams are namely reg,greenb,blue 
the itensity of color is represented using numbers 0 to 256

It also has rgba. the last value is related to opacity. 
We set the opacity value by giving a value of 0 to 1. 
It gets more transparent as it gets closer to 0.




class and id ?

class is a way of using html elements for styling.
they are not unique and have multiple elements. but 
id is unique and it can be assigned to a single element
